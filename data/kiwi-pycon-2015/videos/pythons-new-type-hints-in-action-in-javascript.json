  "summary": "",
  "description": "Depending on who you ask, PEP 484's Type Hints are either the next big\nthing in Python, or the harbinger of doom upon our entire community.\nWhich is it?\n\nAllowing optional static typing in Python will bring with it some\nbenefits that other languages have had for years: IDEs will be able to\ndo code completion better; a whole class of boring tests will fall out\nautomatically; and some bugs will be easier to catch.\n\nBut this is also undeniably a huge change of direction: will it mean you\nhave to substantially change your code style? Will Python's simple\nexpressiveness suddenly become unattainable thanks to clumsy Java-style\ntype declarations?\n\nTo show how PEP 484's Gradual Typing system works, we're going to look\nat TypeScript, a minimal implementation of Gradual Typing over\nJavaScript. We'll see how the type system works, and how it fits into\nthe already thriving JavaScript developer community, where most people\naren't using type hints at all.\n\nWe'll draw some parallels with how Python's implementation will work,\nand see what Python can learn from a language that has successfully made\nthe jump to a type-hinted world.\n",
