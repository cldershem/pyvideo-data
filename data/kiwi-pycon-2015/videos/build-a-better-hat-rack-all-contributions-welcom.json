  "description": "We have many ways of reporting and recognising our code contributions in\nopen source projects, but often it is the work we do outside of code\ncommits themselves that get forgotten and unattributed. Hours of code\nreview, documentation, testing; organising of meetups and volunteering\nat conferences; even just brainstorming and talking about things - how\nmuch of these have you done without accreditation?\n\nDuring this session, we will discuss what it means to contribute to open\nsource projects, what constitutes a non-code contribution, steps we can\ntake to recognise the work of our peers, and how projects can better\nencourage non-code participation through recognition and\nacknowledgement.\n",
