  "description": "Connascence is the taxonomy of coupling: it allows us to specify how two\nor more pieces of code are connected, and suggests ways of minimising\nthe impact of that coupling. Ultimately this allows developers to write\nsoftware that is more flexible to change.\n\nAt the end of the talk the audience will have learned some of the forms\nof connascence with real python code examples, and will understand how\nto apply those principles to their own code.\n",
