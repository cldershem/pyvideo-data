  "summary": "",
  "description": "This talk will covers why to use Cassandra, basic Cassandra\narchitecture, setting up Cassandra, and basic crud operations with a\npython web framework. The Apache Cassandra database is the right choice\nwhen you need scalability and high availability without compromising\nperformance. Linear scalability and proven fault-tolerance on commodity\nhardware or cloud infrastructure make it the perfect platform for\nmission-critical data. Cassandra's support for replicating across\nmultiple datacenters is best-in-class, providing lower latency for your\nusers and the peace of mind of knowing that you can survive regional\noutages. Cassandra's data model offers the convenience of column indexes\nwith the performance of log-structured updates, strong support for\ndenormalization and materialized views, and powerful built-in caching.\n",
