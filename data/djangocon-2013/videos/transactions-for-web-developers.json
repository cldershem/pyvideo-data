  "summary": "TRANSACTIONS FOR WEB DEVELOPERS\n\nAudience level: Intermediate\n\nDESCRIPTION Django has since long outgrown its roots in publishing. It's\nused in enterprise systems, under write-heavy workloads and strong data\nintegrity requirements. But transaction management barely changed since\nthe 0.9x days. Even veterans pull their hair out fighting DatabaseErrors\nwhen they use it. At last transaction handling will be overhauled in\nDjango 1.6. How does the new system work, and why?\n\nABSTRACT This talk will start from the transactional features of\ndatabases and work its way through the Python database API, up to\nDjango's transaction management. It'll explain the downsides of Django's\nhistorical transaction handling and describe the new system introduced\nin Django 1.6.\n",
