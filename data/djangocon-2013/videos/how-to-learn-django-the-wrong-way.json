  "summary": "How to Learn Django the Wrong Way\n\nWednesday 12:15 p.m.--1 p.m.\n\nAudience level: Novice\n\nDescription\n\nCan you remember your very first Django project and some embarrassing\nmistakes you made? Come hear about some 'aha' moments of a novice\nDjangonaut! I'll share valuable lessons I learned by doing things the\nwrong way. If you are a Django novice, you'll learn some pitfalls to\navoid. If you are a seasoned Djangonaut, you can find out challenges\nthat a new Djangonaut, your new hire or mentee may face! Abstract\n\nCan you remember your very first Django project and some mistakes you\nmade? Or are you a Django novice embarking on your first application or\nstruggling with one?\n\nCome hear about my experiences as an entry developer @InVitae. In this\ntalk, I'll give a quick overview of my first Django project and give\nsnapshots to explain how it changed over time. There will be code\nsnippets to show some horrible code I initially wrote, consequences of\nthose code, and improvements that were made later. In the process,\nyou'll find out how I learned Django (more accurately, still learning)\nby doing things the wrong way and how one can learn about good software\nengineering practices through bad practices.\n\nSome potential topics include: Where does this function belong-- in\nmodels or views or another file? Facing the consequences of bad schema\nin an agile programming environment Auto-reloading troubles to removing\nthe cache layer Migrating from function-based views to class-based views\nA posteriori testing\n\nThe goal of this talk is two-fold: to give a fresh perspective on how\nbuilding a Django application may be like for the complete newbie (those\nnew to programming and to Django), and to help prevent other beginners\nfrom making the same mistakes I made.\n",
