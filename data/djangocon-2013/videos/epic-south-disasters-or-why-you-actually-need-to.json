  "summary": "Epic South Disasters: or, Why You Actually Need to Pay Attention to your\nDBMS\n\nWednesday 2 p.m.--2:45 p.m.\n\nAudience level: Intermediate\n\nDescription\n\nUsing South has its gotchas. I'll go over some of them by using colorful\nexamples involving data loss and hard-to-recover states. Abstract\n\nEpic South Disasters: or, why you actually need to pay attention to your\nDBMS\n\nA lot of people use South to manage database migrations. It's a great\naddition to the Django space that allows you to iterate quickly, without\nspending a lot of time writing and testing schema migrations. But what\nhappens when South does things you didn't expect it to do? From the\nquibbles of differing database backends to phantom post\\_save signals\nsent during data migrations, this talk will offer a set of warnings\nillustrated by example. Prepare to be horrified.\n",
