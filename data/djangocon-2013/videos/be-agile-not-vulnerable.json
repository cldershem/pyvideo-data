  "summary": "Be Agile, Not Vulnerable\n\nAudience level: Novice\n\nDescription\n\nSecurity has to be everyone's responsibility, and cannot be managed as a\nfeature.\n\nAbstract\n\nStartups like to \"move fast and break things\"... but how do you ensure\nthat what breaks isn't security? How do you strike a balance and make\nsure you're able to ship quickly while still ensuring that what goes out\nthe door doesn't have vulnerabilities? The answer begins by recognizing\nthat security is a process, not a feature, and this has ramifications\nthroughout the organization. It means that security engineering needs to\nbe everyone's responsibility (instead of a select few), and it means\nthat when security vulnerabilities crop up \u2014 and they will \u2014 the\norganization needs to be prepared and aligned to act quickly.\n",
