  "summary": "",
  "description": "The Hydrological Simulation Program in Fortran (HSPF) is used\nextensively for the assessment of water quantity and water quality\nissues. This presentation will discuss the development of an open-source\nPython package (PyHSPF) for gathering necessary data from the internet\nand using it to build HSPF input files, performing HSPF simulations,\npostprocess results and calibrate parameters. An example application of\nthe software will be presented for a model of the North Skunk River\nBasin, Iowa, that simulates monthly flows over a 30-year time period\nwith a high degree of explanatory power (R squared = 0.85).\n",
