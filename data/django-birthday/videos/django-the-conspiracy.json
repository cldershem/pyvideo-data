  "summary": "",
  "description": "Ten years after the project known as \"Django\" was released to the\npublic, there are still unanswered questions. Why did one of the\noriginal authors flee the country? What happened to all the removed\nmagic? And, more importantly, why are there secret messages hidden in\nthe template parser's regular expressions? I'll be attempting to throw\nlight on some of the dark secrets of Django and, perhaps, finally divine\nits true purpose, after almost a decade of searching.\n",
