  "description": "A couple of years ago, I was faced with one of the scariest situations\nthere is for a self-employed developer: I was burned out. The blinking\ncursor in Vim was taunting me and no number of GitHub issues could\nmotivate me to churn out more than a few lines of code in a day. This\nburnout, though, led me back to an early love: I started teaching full\ntime.This is a talk in two parts. In part one, I\u2019ll talk about some of\nthe teaching triumphs I\u2019ve had and witnessed thanks to a new career, the\nPython and Django worlds, and my employer, Treehouse (and others!). In\nthe second part, I\u2019ll share ways you can start teaching in your own\ncommunities and using your own talents, so we can all make the world\nbetter through learning.\n",
