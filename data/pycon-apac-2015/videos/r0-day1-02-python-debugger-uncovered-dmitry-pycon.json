  "description": "Speaker: Dmitry Trofimov\n\nThis talk will explain how to implement a debugger for Python. We'll start with simple command line debugger, then look how it is implemented in modern IDEs like PyCharm and Pydev. Then we go further in the details and uncover the tricks used to implement some interesting features like multiprocess debugging, debugging of Django and Jinja2 templates and attaching to a launched Python process. \n\nAbout the speaker\n\nWorking on PyCharm project I put my efforts into making development in Python even more pleasurable.\n\nTwitter @DmitryTrofimov\n\u7d44\u7e54/\u516c\u53f8 JetBrains\n\u982d\u929c PyCharm Team Lead\n\nhttps://tw.pycon.org/2015apac/zh/program/39",
