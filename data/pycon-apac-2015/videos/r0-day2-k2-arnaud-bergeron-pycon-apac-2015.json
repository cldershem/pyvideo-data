  "description": "Speaker: Arnaud Bergeron \n\nArnaud is a long-time supporter of open-source who started with a modest patch to OpenBSD about keyboard encodings many years ago. He worked on Sage for a bit as well as submitting various small patches to a number of projects.\n\nWhile doing some machine learning work for his masters he enjoyed working with GPUs so much that he switched his thesis to focus on using GPUs for computations. Soon after he finished his masters, he ended up working as one of the core developers on Theano dealing mostly with improving and expanding the current GPU support.\n\nhttps://tw.pycon.org/2015apac/zh/program/keynote-speaker/",
