  "description": "Speaker: Tzu-ping Chung\n\nPython is a great programming language suitable for a wide variety of purposes. Among all these exciting things, however, there is one area with which Python is not great: GUI applications. In this talk, we will first take a look at existed solutions for GUI programming in Python, comparing their characteristics and features. We will then discuss how GUI programming with Python should be done in an ideal world, and what can be done (or is being done) to take us one step closer to our ideal.\n\nAbout the speaker\n\n\u500b\u4eba\u7db2\u9801\u9023\u7d50\n\nhttps://uranusjr.com/\n\nTwitter @uranusjr\n\u7d44\u7e54/\u516c\u53f8 BIMEtek Co.
