  "description": "Wouldn't it be awesome if ChiPy wrote its own book? We'd be able to get\nBEvERages for weeks, maybe months on the royalty! If so, we'd need to\nsee what's already out there.\n\nThis lightning talk takes a look at O'Reilly's Python books using\nrequests and BeautifulSoup, with a little of scipy's hierarchical\nclustering on the book descriptions. It is presented in an iPython\nnotebook.\n",
