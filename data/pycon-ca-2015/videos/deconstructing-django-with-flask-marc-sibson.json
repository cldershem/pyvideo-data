  "summary": "Motivation: With the rise of micro services, API first sites and mobile the draw of a lightweight framework is stronger than ever.  Django and its proscriptive batteries included approach can feel too heavy.\n\n- Django is awesome, but maybe I'm missing something with Flask thing. OMG, where do I start, there my so many choices\n- Major components of Django: ORM, routing, templating, views, forms, migrations, configuration, ReST, models, tasks, tests, static assets, authentication, sessions etc\n- templating, forms, static assets aren\u2019t really needed for api/mobile use cases\n- for each remaining component offer the \u201cbest\u201d flask library\n- build out a small API only app together using the \"\"best\"\" flask library",
