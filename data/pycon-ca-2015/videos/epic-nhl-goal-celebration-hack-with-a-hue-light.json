  "title": "Epic NHL goal celebration hack with a hue light show and real-time machine learning",
  "summary": "This talk shows how Python was used to trigger an epic sound and light show whenever the Montreal Canadiens hockey team scored a goal in last season's playoffs.\n\nThe author trained a machine learning model to detect in real-time that a goal was just scored by the Habs based on the live audio feed of a game and to trigger a light show using Philips hues in his living room. The system was built using various Python modules, more specifically scikit-learn, pyaudio, librosa, phue and bottle.\n\nThe talk will cover every step of the hack from the creation of the dataset, the feature generation and the machine learning model training, the real-time audio feed processing to do real-time scoring and the programming of the light show.",
