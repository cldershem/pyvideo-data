  "summary": "You might have heard from smart people that dynamic languages are not suitable for large projects. We're going to look at what it takes to manage one of the largest Python projects powering public clouds at Dreamhost and Rackspace as well as private ones at CERN: Openstack!\n\nWe'll gather some data about current Openstack deployments used in production, review some source code from various projects, see some anecdotes from devops people who deploy these systems, and explore the infrastructure and quality assurance processes used to maintain this massive code base.",
