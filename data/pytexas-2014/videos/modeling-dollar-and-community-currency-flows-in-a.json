  "description": "John Boik is the author of the new book \"Economic Direct Democracy: A\nFramework to End Poverty and Maximize Well-Being.\" John will delve into\nhis Python-based simulation model of flows of the dollar and a proposed\ncommunity currency (called the token) in a virtual US county. He gives\nbackground on the proposed community currency system, called the Token\nExchange System, explores how the model is structured, presents modeling\nresults, and discusses potential social impact as guided and informed\nhis book's thesis. As a hint of scale and potential impact, annual\ncurrency flows in the simulation model are measured in the billions. A\nglobal partnership of interested academic, civil society, government,\nbusiness, and philanthropy groups is now forming to move the book's\nproposal forward.\n\nSimulation model background:\nhttp://www.principledsocietiesproject.org/simulation-model/\n\nPython TES-simulation Package:\nhttps://pypi.python.org/pypi/TES-simulation\n\nProject and book details: http://www.principledsocietiesproject.org/\n",
