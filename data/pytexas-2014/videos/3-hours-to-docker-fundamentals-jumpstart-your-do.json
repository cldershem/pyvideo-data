Docker provides a\nmechanism for low overhead virtualization and can be a key aspect of a\nDevOps architecture. Docker allows isolated environments to be created\nin a single machine without imposing a performance overhead. This leads\nto new possibilities for optimizing the developer flows and creating\nmulti-tenant applications, saving time coding and improving quality.\n\nThis tutorial will highlight a list of best practices, pitfalls, and dos\nand dont\u2019s from real-world case studies. We\u2019ll walk through:\n\n-  Basic concepts and Docker terminology\n-  Docker Commands\n-  Must Know Docker Features\n-  Docker in the real world using examples of projects implemented at\n   Flux7\n\n",
