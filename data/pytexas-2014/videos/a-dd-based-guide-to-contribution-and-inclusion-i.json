  "description": "The Python community needs many different types of contributions to\nthrive. If you ever thought, \"I'm not a great programmer, so I can't\ncontribute to the Python community. :-(\", you're WRONG!\n\nFirst, using classes and roles from Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) as a lens,\nwe'll look at multiple contributing roles in the Python community, and\nhow you can find one that fits you. Not familiar with D&D? I'll provide\na brief, relevant primer.\n\nNext, we'll continue the discussion to see how Inclusiveness helps us\nget those different contributors into the Python community. To use D&D\nlanguage, a party of only one class won't go far. We'll also look at how\nInclusiveness is NOT the same thing as Diversity or Political\nCorrectness.\n",
