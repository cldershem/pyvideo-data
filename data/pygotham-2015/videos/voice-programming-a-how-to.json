  "summary": "",
  "description": "Despite the many people who suffer from RSI, the subject of programming\nby voice is still a relatively unexplored one. Although there are\nnumerous proof-of-concept demonstrations available online and many\nbrilliant pieces of software that make voice programming possible, much\nof the configuration and learning of best practices are left to the\nuser. This talk will cover what exactly goes into creating and using a\nvoice programming environment.\n",
