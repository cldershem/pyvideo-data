  "summary": "",
  "description": "Development environments are a necessary part of every developer's\nworkflow. They can also be a great source of friction. What may begin as\nsimply running ``python my_app.py`` eventually bloats as you add more\napps, more databases, more testing frameworks, and more developers.\nWe'll talk about the evolution of a typical development environment, how\nit lets us down, and how we try to make it better. We'll end with an\nintroduction to Dusty, a new tool which uses Docker containers to take\nour development environments to the next level.\n",
