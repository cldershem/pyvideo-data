  "summary": "",
  "description": "The LLVM Compiler Infrastructure Project provides a convenient,\ntransportable intermediate representation (LLVM-IR) which can be\ncompiled and linked into multiple types of machine-dependent assembly\ncode. TupleWare is a new analytical framework built at Brown University\nthat allows users to compile functions into distributed programs that\nare automatically deployed. TupleWare compiles user functions to\nLLVM-IR, and C++ code is generated and applied to the data through the\ndistributed framework. This talk will go through the steps of writing a\ncomprehensive Python front-end for TupleWare with a focus on the\nconstruction of a compiler from a limited subset of Python to LLVM-IR.\n",
