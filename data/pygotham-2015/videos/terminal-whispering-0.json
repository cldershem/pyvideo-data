  "description": "The terminal emulators we run so many of our programming tools in are\nmore powerful than we remember to give them credit for, and the key to\nthat power is understanding the interface. This talk will cover terminal\ncolors and styles, writing to arbitrary portions of the screen, handling\nsignals from the terminal, determining the terminal's dimensions and\nscrollback buffer behavior.\n",
