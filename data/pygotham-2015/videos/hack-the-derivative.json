  "summary": "",
  "description": "Numerical estimates of the derivative of a function are typically done\nusing an approximation called \"Finite Difference.\" However, the accuracy\nof this method is computationally bounded. Using Complex Analysis, we're\nable to take the step in the imaginary direction on the complex plane\nand achieve near perfect estimation of the derivative in only three\nlines of code!\n",
