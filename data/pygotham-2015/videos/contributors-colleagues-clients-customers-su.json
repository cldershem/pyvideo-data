  "summary": "",
  "description": "When it comes to open source software, what do you want to be doing? Do\nyou want an occasional hobby where you can have fun contributing back to\nthe community? Have a significant impact on the world by being able to\ncommit full time to growing the available pool of free & open source\nsoftware? Spend time getting to know the needs of a particular\norganisation, and applying open source tools to solve their problems? Or\nperhaps you'd prefer to understand the general needs of a broad category\nof potential users, and design open source tools that will solve their\nproblems without customisation?\n\nGetting involved in open source development communities can offer all\nthese opportunities and more, but it also makes it incredibly easy for\nus to overcommit and burn ourselves out. If we're not careful, our\nunrealistic expectations can also contribute to the burnout of our\npeers. To ensure sustainability, we need to come to a shared\nunderstanding of some of the different ways we can engage with open\nsource communities, what we can reasonably offer for free, and what we\nshould expect to be paid for.\n",
