  "summary": "",
  "description": "In New York City, building management agents and steam heating\ncontractors alike typically work with hundreds of buildings and at least\nas many boilers. When there is an issue with the boiler, they need to be\nable to get as much data about that specific boiler as quickly as\npossible. Thankfully, the New York City Department of Buildings (DOB)\nand the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) have published\ndatabases online with various data on publicly registered boilers and\nburners. In this talk, I will discuss the methods I have used to scrape\nthese boiler and burner data from the web using python libraries.\n",
