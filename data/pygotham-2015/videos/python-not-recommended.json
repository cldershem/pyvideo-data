  "description": "At Braintree, we've moved away from using Python. We've always used Ruby\nas our primary language, but Python used to be the go-to choice for\nthings where Ruby wasn't a good fit. I will discuss the problems we've\nhad with Python, why we decided to move to other solutions, and what\nwe've chosen instead. Finally, I'll talk about where we're continuing to\nuse Python and what the future holds.\n",
