  "summary": "The Other Hard Problem: Lessons and Advice on Naming Things\n\nThere are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation\nand naming things. -- Phil Karlton\n\nThis quote finds its way into many-a-talk about caching systems\n(including my own), and sometimes we as developers will recall it when\nwe spend an hour to name that one nebulous variable. But why is\nsomething so difficult as nomenclature also thought of as too simple to\nactually talk about?\n\nIn this talk, I'll review what has been written in the last few decades\non naming, go over the easy parts of right or wrong as defined in PEP8\nand other style guidelines, and finally suggest some patterns and\nanti-patterns found in in today's Django and open source environment for\nus to adopt (or avoid!) in our everyday naming of variables, libraries\nand other \"things\".\n",
