Dustin Whittle shares the latest\ntechniques and tools for performance testing modern web and mobile\napplications. Join this session and learn how to capacity plan and\nevaluate performance and the scalability of the server-side through\nSiege, Bees with Machine Guns, and Locust.io. We will dive into modern\nperformance testing on the client-side and how to leverage\nnavigation/resource timing apis and tools like Google PageSpeed and\nSiteSpeed.io to understand the real world performance of your users. We\nwill cover how HTTP2 and modern browsers change the game for performance\noptimization with new best practices.
