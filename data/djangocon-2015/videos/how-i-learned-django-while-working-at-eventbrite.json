  "summary": "How I learned Django while working at Eventbrite by Allison Lacker\n\nWe all are constantly learning new technologies and strategies to be\nmore effective at our jobs, or just because they interest us. How do you\nbalance the need to stay on top of the latest and greatest changes in\nour industry with making a product? How do you take a new hire with\namazing potential and help them learn everything they need to know,\nwhile shipping at the same time?\n\nShipping code as soon as possible isn't a cutthroat business decision.\nIt helps people learn faster, be more effective, feel more valued, and\nkeeps them centered on the right goals.\n\nHow do you balance learning with shipping code? Is there any reason they\nhave to be separate? Too often we feel that these are discrete tasks.\n\nBenefits of learning technology by applying it to real world problems\nare: - Fixing a real world problem - Learning something that is\nimmediately useful - Remembering it better than if you had learned the\ntheory\n\nDangers to consider include: - Not everyone learns the same way - Real\nworld problems can be vastly more difficult than you expect, unless\nyou've already solved them - Revealing embarrassing legacy code and\ndecisions earlier than you'd like\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/HJch/\n",
