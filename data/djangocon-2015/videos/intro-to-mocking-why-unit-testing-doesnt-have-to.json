  "summary": "Intro to Mocking: Why Unit Testing Doesn't Have To Be So Hard by Daniel\nDavis\n\nMany developers want to write better code, but simply don't know how to\nwrite units tests for:\n\nCode that calls other code (i.e. code with dependencies) Methods that\nhave no return value Code that throws exceptions Mocking provides a\nvaluable tool for solving these problems. In this talk, we'll discuss\nthe scenarios in which Mocking is useful, the strategies for addressing\neach of the cases above and write simple, clean unit tests using the\nbuilt-in Mock library.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/HH6d/\n",
