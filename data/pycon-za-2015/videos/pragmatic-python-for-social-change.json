  "description": "`Code for South Africa <http://code4sa.org>`__ is a civic technology lab\nthat uses Python and open data to promote informed decision making to\ndrive social change. We use our skills for social good.\n\nWe build tools like `Living Wage <http://living-wage.co.za/>`__ for\ncalculating fair wages for domestic workers,\n`Wazimap.co.za <http://wazimap.co.za>`__ for exploring your\nneighbourhood through statistics, `Medicine Prices\n(mpr.code4sa.org) <http://mpr.code4sa.org>`__ for finding cheaper\ngenerics of prescription medicines,\n`OpenByLaws.org.za <http://openbylaws.org.za>`__ for local legislation\nthat's easy to read and share, and `PMG.org.za <http://pmg.org.za>`__\nfor keeping an eye on Parliament.\n\nIn this talk we'll discuss what civic technology means, how you can get\ninvolved, and the why, what and how of our approach to building and\nrunning more than 25 websites, services and applications with a small\nbudget and an even smaller team.\n",
