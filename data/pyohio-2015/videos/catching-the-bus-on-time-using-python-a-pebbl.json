  "summary": "",
  "description": "Taking the bus used to be hard. You'd have to find a timetable, map out\nyour route, and then cross your fingers that the bus actually showed up\non time! Modern transit systems have equipped their fleet with GPS\ndevices which provide near real-time location information. Using open\ndata systems, a Python webapp, and a Pebble watch, let's build a bus\ntime tracker that would make Dick Tracy envious!\n",
